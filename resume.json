      "releaseDate": "2013-04-30",
      "summary": "Photography is the art of light. At its most basic, a photograph is capturing light and recording it on a two dimensional plane. As one proceeds down your photographic journey, you begin to recognize hugely varying qualities of light, and how light, and the absence of light, can define a scene and am image. As my friend Rick Sammon often says, “Light illuminates, Shadows define.”\n\nColor and light are as intricately linked as, well, electricity and magnetism. My geek readers will appreciate the analogy… or lack of analogy. The range and strength of color can draw your attention, bring memories to the forefront, or drive your attention to vacillate between two complementary colors in a scene. Even the lack of color in a black and white image is important, as our expectations and experiences will let us fill in what we expect to see in our mind’s eye.\n\nLight and Color are the two aspects for which most photographers and viewers are most familiar, even if they have not thought of them as explicitly defined in this way. The final component, however, is just as important but less commonly thought of as a direct function of an image.\n\nWhat is Gesture? Gesture is movement, an expression, an essence. Gesture is most easily explained in the context of an image of a person but is not constrained there. In fact, what I personally found the most moving, and challenging, is the extension of Gesture to inanimate objects.",
